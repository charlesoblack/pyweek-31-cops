# C.O.P.S.: Cops Organize Paper Stacks

Team members: Kendra Lemon, Guido Petri

This is our entry to Pyweek 31. It's a game about a cop who has to organize some paperwork.

## Running the game

The only dependency our game has is `pygame==2.0.1`. (this can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

Running the game is done via:

```bash
./run_game.py
```

in the same folder this README file is in.

## Controls

The controls are simply: `ASDF`, `JKL;` for sending paper to each stack; and spacebar for advancing screens.

We used [Python](www.python.org) and [pygame](www.pygame.org) to code our game.
